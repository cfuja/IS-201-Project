        <h2>Interests</h2>
        <p>I am interested in many things including ballet, music, business, art, and reading. However, my favorite thing to do for relaxation is to spend time with my family.</p>
        <h4>Ballet</h4>
        <p>I love dancing ballet and it is one of my favorite passtimes. However, I have not been able to do it recently because of having double knee surgery twice, but now I can get back to it over the next summer!</p>
        <h4>Music</h4>
        <p>I really enjoy listening to music. My favorite music genres are classical and jazz. Jazz is one of my favorite genres of music becuase it allows me to express myself. I love listening to the classics such as Frank Sinatra, Ella Fitzgerald, Dean Martin, Nat King Cole, Bobby Darin, and Tony Benett. My family and I often go to live jazz concerts put on by Excellence in the Community. I love listening to classical music and I even play a bit of piano. I have played many works including Bach's "Preluce I in C Major". Currently, I am working on two pieces: "Claire De Lune" by Claude Debussy and "Christophori's Dream" by David Lanz.</p>

        <h4>Art</h4>
        <p>I really enjoy painting. One of my favorite things to paint are landscapes and especially beach landscapes. My favorite acrylic painting that I have ever done is of a secluded beach that my family and I frequent while we are visiting in Newport Beach, California. The beach is called Woods Cove Beach or Diamond Beach and the painting is of a fiery sunset I also enjoy sketching flowers and floorplans</p>
        <h4>Business</h4>
        <p>I have a passion for business. I have taken many business courses and I enjoyed them so much. I love being able to look at problems and come up with innovative solutions as well as demonstrating my leadership as I strive to complete tasks and work with teams.</p>
        <h2>Education</h2>
        <h4>AP Courses</h4>
        <p>I took many AP courses at a young age and exceeded. I learned many things when taking these courses, one of which is that to suceed at something, you must be prepared. My favorite AP exam was AP Biology because it allowed me to grow the most both in practical application and critical thinking.</p>
        <h4>CE Courses</h4>
        <p>The Concurrent Enrollment courses that I took allowed me to stay on top of things and learn how best to organize. My organiztional skills and my ability to meet deadlines greatly grew throughout these courses as I had to take responsibility for the assignments and due dates.</p>
        <h4>BYU Independent Study</h4>
        <p>The BYU Independent Study courses that I took helped me to truly find my love for business. As I have taken the core business courses through Independent Study, it has helped me to find my passion in life as well as discover what in business I am best at.</p>
