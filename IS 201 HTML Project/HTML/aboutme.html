        <h2>Interests</h2>
        <p>I am interested in many things including ballet, music, business, art, and reading. However, my favorite thing to do for relaxation is to spend time with my family.</p>
        <h4>Ballet</h4>
        <p>I love dancing ballet and it is one of my favorite passtimes. However, I have not been able to do it recently because of having double knee surgery twice, but now I can get back to it over the next summer!</p>
        <h4>Music</h4>
        <p>I really enjoy listening to music. My favorite music genres are classical and jazz. I love listening to classical music and I even play a bit of piano. I have played many works including Bach's "Preluce I in C Major". Currently, I am working on two pieces: "Claire De Lune" by Claude Debussy and "Christophori's Dream" by David Lanz.</p>
